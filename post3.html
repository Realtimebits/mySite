          Fad, fiction or a practical utility? Practical utility, that’s how I would describe the food dehydrator
          machine. And that is exactly why it is quickly finding its place in the kitchens of the Western, Eastern, and
          the urban and the rural homes.
          Dehydrators help to dry foods and help to preserve them for a longer duration of time. It is a practice which
          has been in use since time immemorial; only, the technology has been updated. So if you told your granny or
          great-granny about the dehydrator and its use, she is not going to be stunned with your new idea. She may stun
          you instead! She has been doing it since ever.
        </div>
        <p>
          The practice of drying foods like vegetables and fruits after harvest and animal proteins has been in effect
          since antiquity. But as far as technology goes? Yup, she’s going to dig your style of doing it the
          “tech-savvy” and the “convenient way” and that too, so “easily.” She may want to buy one too as all that she
          has
          to do is
          operate one button. So if you are thinking of buying her a gift, buy the dehydrator that she may appreciate.
        </p>

        <h3>Why have we been dehydrating food since ever?</h3>
        <p>To preserve food naturally and much longer. What makes the food go bad is the moisture in it. The dehydrator
          simply removes the moisture to help the food last much longer and beat the due expiry date, manifolds. The
          dehydrator uses the combination of heat and airflow to get rid of the unwanted moisture that spoils the food.
        </p>
        <p>
          The food drying method is a food preservation method as it stops the growth of yeast, bacteria, and mold
          with water removal. The dried food varieties as nuts, seeds, fruits last up to a year and some items go
          beyond
          and last up to 2 years.
        </p>
        <h3>So, how does the dehydrator work?</h3>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb fa-2x"></i>
          The dehydrators use the scientifically tested technique of heat
          circulation that permits the heat to
          travel through each of the trays. This process helps to get rid of the excess moisture systematically with
          the aid
          of heating element, air vents, fan, and food trays.</li>
        </p>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb fa-2x"></i>
          The trio- (the heating element along with the fan and the
          vents) work collaboratively to remove the moisture and circulate the air. With the help of low
          temperature,
          the moisture is released from the food into the dehydrator.
        </p>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb fa-2x"></i>
          The fan assists the heating element to dry up the food
          further and keep the air smell free. Which also means that you can dry a variety of items at a go without
          conflict in their smell or flavor. But, as far as the green onions or pungent smelling items go, avoid
          mixing them.
        </p>

        <h3>A Healthy Choice…</h3>
        <p><i class="fa-brands fa-apple fa-2x"></i>Since the dehydrator dries up the food at low temperature, it keeps
          the enzymes in the food undamaged and
          prevents the growth of microorganisms. So you needn’t add any preservatives additionally. Dehydrated
          vegetables and fruits do not require additional salt or sugar preservatives. Plus it gives the complete fiber
          content and minerals as the whole fruit does. </p>
        <p><i class="fa-brands fa-apple fa-2x"></i>The canned varieties come packed with preservatives and many times
          they
          contain invisible bacteria. But with
          the dried food, you can easily tell if it goes bad as the mold shows up. </p>
        <p><i class="fa-brands fa-apple fa-2x"></i>Also, the food above 118° F is considered cooked as it loses
          nutritional values. That is why the dehydrated
          food varieties are dried up at lower temperature between 105° F to 115° F or 41° C to 46° C which help retain
          97% of nutritional value in the food item. </p>


        <h3>Convenient and Easy to Operate</h3>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-hands-bubbles fa-2x"></i> The dehydrating process is flexible, foolproof and efficient.
          With just a click of a button you may dry a
          single fruit or a basketful, it is your option. The dehydrators come with trays, so you can dry the desired
          quantity. What’s more? There is the option of sliding slots in trays of food. So you may even dry a variety of
          things in a tray.
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-hands-bubbles fa-2x"></i> Most dehydrators come with a combination of different variety
          of trays that suit the dry and the moister
          varieties. You can put the drier varieties as whole fruit and vegetables directly onto the mesh trays at the
          top. For the wetter varieties as the batter of bread or crackers, there is usually an option of Teflex-sheet
          covered mesh trays, which may be kept at the bottom. And what is the great part that you simply cannot
          mess-up? You simply cannot over-dry as the temperatures are
          so low!</p>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-pointer fa-2x"></i> But you would have to be aware of the weather when keeping
          your
          dried food outside to cool off. Make sure it
          is not a rainy or a humid day as that will simply rehydrate your dehydrated produce and undo the process. And
          you would have to do it all over again! </p>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-point-right fa-2x"></i> Also since the process takes from 4-5 hours, you can
          switch on the dehydrator and get about other chores at
          home on the weekends. </p>
        <h3>Dehydrators help maintain your Wallet</h3>

        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-piggy-bank fa-2x"></i> The dehydrators allow you to stock up large quantities of
          preserves which work out much cheaper than the
          marketed price. The dehydrators allow you to enjoy the off-season produce bought at the right price just after
          the harvest. And the machines themselves are not shockingly expensive. The dehydrators are great for large
          families, camping or for folks who have healthy appetites. </p>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-piggy-bank fa-2x"></i> Most of the dehydrators are expandable and you may buy more
          trays and layers as per your need. </p>

        <h3>What all can you preserve and do with the Dehydrator?</h3>
        <p><i class="fa-brands fa-nutritionix fa-2x"></i> Well, most people use them to dehydrate vegetables, fruits,
          nuts, herbs, and seeds. You have the option of eating them dried or use them in pizza sauce to cobblers. You
          can even use the dried vegetables in the ‘instant soup mix’ for instance. Or do as some other creative foodies
          do- you can enjoy the veggie mix powder with green onion powder in your scrambled eggs. </p>
        <p><i class="fa-brands fa-nutritionix fa-2x"></i></i> Some people even make crispy snacks like crackers, potato
          chips, and
          kale chips. You can make delicious crackers by just spreading-out a mixture of soaked nuts or sprouted grains,
          flax and veggies. For the sweeter assortment, the infamous chewy fruit leather or pancakes and cookies would
          be the choice of satisfaction. </p>
        <p><i class="fa-brands fa-nutritionix fa-2x"></i></i> The dehydrator machine allows you to preserve the seasonal
          produce in
          a healthy manner negating the use of preservatives. It helps retain 97% of the nutritional food value. You can
          keep your costs low by using homemade vegetable and seed and onion chunks which you can eat as is or powder
          them and rehydrate them in sauces, pasta, and other dishes. You can preserve from small to large quantities
          and enjoy them even during the offseason for a year or even two in some cases.</p>
        <p>All in all, the dehydrator machine is a great bonus which helps you to save time, money and preserve health.
          The dehydrators make great gift items for closer and important associations.</p>
